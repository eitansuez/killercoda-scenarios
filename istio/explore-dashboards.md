#### Explore the dashboards

The `istioctl` CLI provides convenience commands for accessing the web UIs for each dashboard.

Take a moment to review the help information for the `istioctl dashboard` command:

```{.shell .language-shell}
istioctl dashboard --help
```

Proceed to explore each of the dashboards using the above command.
Your instructor will give a demonstration of each dashboard, time permitting.
